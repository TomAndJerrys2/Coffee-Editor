Text-Editor and Custom Shell for Programming. This tool was designed to make it easier for me to do systems
tasks quicker. Built mainly on Rust and Python for speed and tooling, the CoffeeEditor is a free standing binary
that can run on most operating system architectures (MacOS/Debian/Win64 Support).

Mainly built to support me in coding my operating system - feel free to try it out!
