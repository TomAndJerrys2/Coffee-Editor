# Coffee Terminal

The Coffee Terminal is the in-built terminal inside of the Coffee Editor. It is very different in functionality
from the in-built OS "Coffee Console" which displays a whole spectrum behaviour. This is used to access the CoffeeLang
interpreter, create local file structures and handle I/O operations, file operations etc. Dynamic memory allocation is designed
from stratch with the standard implementation ideas of "malloc.h"

# Commands
